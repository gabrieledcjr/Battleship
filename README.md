intention of me posting my programs is for collaboration and to hear 
feedbacks on possible improvements on the coding. This code repository also serves as my code

This program simulates the game of Battleship. The game was created with C. Since it's a two player game between a user vs the computer, there is some implementation of AI. Will be focusing more on revising the AI on this.
